## How many loc should a mature developer deliver a day
&emsp;&emsp;First, a mature developer, I think, don't care how many loc they need deliver. They care more about code quality. The beautiful code they write can make them feel proud.
&emsp;&emsp;However, the number of the code is the task for them. They must finish it. For me, I think they need write 500-600 lines a day. Of course, they also need rest, so, They can work for five days and then take a day off. So that, they can keep their best condition.
&emsp;&emsp;Now, I am a student and study se. So I want to become a mature developer. To achieve this goal, I will work hard and study more new things.
